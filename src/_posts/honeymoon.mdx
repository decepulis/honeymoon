## Our Story

I wasn't looking for something when I met Server Components. I was just looking for a better way to write layouts for our [docs](https://docs.mux.com/). _Next_ thing I knew, I was fetching data directly in my components and streaming them to the client. It was love at first sight.

And now, everywhere I look, I see our beautiful future together

```javascript
import { Tweet } from 'react-tweet';

export default function Page() {
  return <Tweet id="1686695126465204225" />;
}
```
